# Symmetric/Assymetric Encryption & Hashing
A project made for "Information Systems Security"

- AES/RSA/SHA 2 written from scratch (no libraries used)

In order to see the demonstration run 'demo.py'. This contains a small represtantion of every method.
Every data input is given by-hand in this file, change it manually if you want to test more inputs.

The values has to be given in this specific form as they are in 'demo.py' (Lists).

The code might be more extensive than it should but i wanted to be easy-to-read.

Keys are saved as listed:
-	key.txt   : AES key
-	keys.pair : RSA public,private key
-	key.pub   : RSA public key
-	key.sec   : RSA private key
